PROJECT OVERVIEW
This report highlights the steps taken to create a portal for a business management User interface. The interface is built to keep track of products, users and inventory for a specific business. The platform allows the admin to export charts seamlessly as well as update a company’s database. It allows the administrator to monitor key factors like Return on Investment and schedule/ manage tasks to be assigned to employees.
PROBLEM STATEMENT
When working within an organization, it can be difficult to keep track of products, employees and sales without an interface. The dashboard is built to create a platform on which statistics  and reports about each product, employee and sales are put in one place. 
DESIRED END STATE
The desired end state of the project is autonomy throughout the entire system. The user’s only task is to input data and the system is able to recognize, store and convert it into useful information. Listed below are the  desired characteristics of a fully functional dashboard.
The system should be linked to a database that updates continuously. The integration should be seamless.
The system should allow the administrator to adjust tables and export charts
The administrator should be the only one able to access to dashboard for safety reasons
The system should accurately calculate  and update values as they are adjusted
The system should be able to display responsive charts.
REQUIREMENTS
In order for this system to work, there needs to be an administrator. The administrator needs to create a user, view sales and products statistics as well as inventory. The charts and tables should be exportable and should adjust if new input is added.  The system should then use this information to create a dashboard in which the user can view recommendations, progress and vital information about the current status of the business. Both the administrator and user should be able to view their own respective portals but users should not be able to input data. The administrator needs to be the only one with access to the dataset and should be the only one that can edit information. In order for the system to work autonomously, the following needs to be implemented:
A secure database that holds employee data.
A front-end interface like a website or web application that displays the information  as a dashboard.

SYSTEM REQUEST

Systems Request for Productivity Dashboard 
Project Sponsor
The project is being made for the University of Washington for TINFO 482 for a music shop in Tacoma.
Business Need
This project has been created to keep track of inventory, sales and employees.
Currently:
There is no set interface to manage reports, analysis and collect information on a business.
Reports and data gathering is being done manually with  record books and receipts.
Business Requirements
When used, this system will allow administrators to:
Delegate tasks
Schedule meetings
Keep track of inventory
Keep track of staff and commissions
Keep track of sales
Business Value
This project will lead to complete analysis of business functions creating room for improvement. If a business is able to monitor key indicators, it is easier to plan for success:
Seamless production of reports and scheduling tasks
Effortless project planning and inventory management.
Monitoring of sales


Constraints
The dashboard could increase the complexity of scheduling and project planning.
If left unsecure, critical company data can be leaked or ransomed by cyber criminals
Lack of knowledge on how to build a user interface




CONSTRAINTS
The constraints of this system mainly lie with concerns about autonomy. If the datasets are unreliable, incorrect or not updated regularly, the dashboard  will display incorrect recommendations. Other demerits or constraints are:
If left unsecure, the exposure of personal employee information would damage the organization. Threats can be made for ransom of this data and it becomes an asset that an organization needs to secure as vulnerabilities are not an option.
Data can be corrupted or lost if the administrator is unsure of the instructions.
Server Side communication is difficult to learn and so the system might not respond as quickly.

USE CASES
The first use case is when a small business is looking to increase sales. The business can use the Sales and Products section to monitor inventory, investments, profits and commissions to determine the best course of action to increase revenue. With insight, it is easier to make decisions that are beneficial to the company,
The second use case is of an administrator that would like to create a report that displays employee information, sales information, or product information for a staff meeting about the future of an organization.
The third use case is when an administrator would like to view and schedule tasks to employees within an organization. The administrator can use the tasks bar to dedicate time to tasks as well as view the work that is yet to be completed in a kanban board
